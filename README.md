As part of *Northcoder's Skills Bootcamp in Software Development*, we were tasked with building a C.R.U.D. news application frontend which uses information from my other [backend project](https://github.com/M1nhnho/be-nc-news). This app allows clients to view articles, grouped under topics, along with comments and the users behind them - akin to Reddit or similar news services.

This frontend project was built in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript using [React](https://react.dev/) to enable easier management by splitting parts into reusable components that can be conditionally rendered. Error handling has been implemented and various in-built hooks have been used along with my own custom hooks. Responsiveness was also kept in consideration and [WAVE](https://wave.webaim.org/) was used for accessibility to conform to WCAG 2.2 at Level AA. Moreover, [Axios](https://axios-http.com/) was used to access my backend API.

## Hosted version
